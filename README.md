# SmashOrPass
#### A Smash Or Pass WebApp built with Django( a Python web Framework). It is basically a Web Application which displays pictures of girls and then, you can either _"Smash"_ or _"Pass"_ them.
---
This webapp allows you to create an account and login to the account created. While logged in, your _**"Smashes"**_ will be saved to your account and then, you'll be able to see all the pictures that you smashed and also delete them.
If you aren't logged in, you won't be able to see the pictures that you smashed.

The major reason why I built this project is because I'm currently learning web development with Python and so, I wanted to try out building something that was original. Not copied from any YouTube tutorial.
So, that became my biggest motivation to build and finish this project.
During the development of this project, I encountered a lot of issues and problems which I couldn't solve for minutes. I'm glad I faced them head-on because now, I can boldly say that **I KNOW THEM**.
